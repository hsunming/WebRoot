          <p>Detail oriented. Father of twin boys.</p>
          <p>I was born in South Korea. Moved to Taiwan when I was five. Then when I was eight, I moved to Okinawa, Japan, where I grew up.</p>
          <p>I have been in Washington State since 1991. Wow that's getting close to 30 years!</p>
          <p>I have two daughters. One is going to college now and the other will start next year.</p>
          <p>My twin boys are almost two and half years old. They are a lot of work. A LOT!</p>
